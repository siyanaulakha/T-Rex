## T-REX GAME
A Java-based desktop recreation of the classic Chrome T-Rex endless runner game, developed as a personal project to explore object-oriented programming, game loops, and real-time application logic.
This project extends the original concept by introducing three distinct gameplay versions, each offering a unique experience.

## Game Versions / Modes
1. Classic T-Rex Mode

The original endless runner experience inspired by the Chrome offline T-Rex game. Players control the dinosaur to jump over obstacles while the game speed and difficulty progressively increase.

2. Corona-Inspired Mode

A themed variation inspired by the COVID-era concept, featuring customized visuals and gameplay elements. This mode introduces a different aesthetic while retaining the core endless runner mechanics.

3. Mini Dino Mode

A playful variation featuring a smaller dinosaur character. The change in character scale affects gameplay dynamics and adds variety to the overall experience.

## Technical Highlights:

Implemented a real-time game loop for smooth rendering and gameplay

Used object-oriented design to separate player logic, obstacles, rendering, and game state

Mode-based architecture allowing seamless switching between different game versions

Implemented collision detection, obstacle generation, and score tracking

Event handling for responsive keyboard controls


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources: conatins the code, and assests which include images used in the code.
  (the images are in png format and are pixelated)
  

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
